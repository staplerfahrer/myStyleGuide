# A Case For camelCase
Better put, dromedaryCase. Because some camels have two humps. 

1. one less character used, compared to - and _ 
2. one less keystroke vs _ 
3. unambigouous word boundary, no word*CURSOR*\_word vs word\_*CURSOR*word 
4. no need to hit the relatively hard-to-reach - 
5. keyboards have **two** large shift-keys to help capitalize the next letter
